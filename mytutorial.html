            In Christ alone my hope is found
            <br>He is my light, my strength, my song
            <br>This cornerstone, this solid ground
            <br>Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
            <br>What heights of love, what depths of peace
            <br>When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
            <br>My comforter, my all in all
            <br>Here in the love of Christ I stand
            </div>

        <p> 
            <div style="color: yellow;">
            In Christ alone, who took on flesh
            <br>Fullness of God in helpless babe
            <br>This gift of love and righteousness
            <br>Scorned by the ones He came to save
            <br>'Til on that cross as Jesus died
            <br>The wrath of God was satisfied
            <br>For every sin on Him was laid
            <br>Here in the death of Christ I live
