            <br>I'm His dear one. 
            <br>Every act of love, every term of affection, every cares, every high-five, every smile is because of Him. 
            <br>He create everything good. 
            <br>He create love. 
            <br>He brings forth love.
            <br>I'm not like trees pushed over, roots pulled up from the ground.
            <br>They lie there, roots exposed, vulnerable, thirsty and desperate, drying up for lack of care, lack of nourishment, attention and love.

            <div style="color: white;">
                <br>He brings forth love in me, dear one.
                <br>He brings forth goodness and He raise me up to stand, to not cower and hide but to stand.
                <br>I can feel like crying, hiding, running and turning far, far away, while He stand.
                <br>I stand because He stand with me.
                <br>I'm a warrior, a gentle, fierce, mighty, heroic, beautiful, glorious warrior in His name.
                <br>He foster  me beauty, gentleness and humbleness, a full heart with Him.
                <br>And this is all, only because... with Him, I stand.
                <br>He stand amidst storms and droughts.
                <br>He stand through heartache, sickness, loss and death.
                <br>He stand when I cannot stand.
                <br>He stands because I cannot.
                <br>He stands because He wants to.

                    <div style="color: white;">
                        <br>He likes being here with me.
                        <br>He come, rescued one.
                        <br>He come, beautiful one.
                        <br>He come, dellightful one.
                        <br>He come, fierce one.
                        <br>I stand because in me He've placed roots nourished by His love.
                        <br>Held, steadfast His light love.
                        <br>His love is what is strong.
                        <br>His love is what hold me secure.
                        <br>I keep thinking about Him, eyes on Him.
                        <br>He can help me lean on Him.
                        <br>He can help me love Him, His the creator of love.
                        <p>There's more than enough love to go around.</p>
                        <p>So, I ask Him.</p>
                        <p>I will ask Him for more love in my heart.</p>
                        <p>I will ask Him to help me see what He sees-what my roots looks like, how He care for me, how He does more than just to help me stand.</p>
